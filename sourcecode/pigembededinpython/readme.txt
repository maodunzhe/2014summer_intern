The pig embedded in python script with a java udf can be found online with both the 1 dimension and 2 dimensions. I try to modify it and figure it out for a while although the performance is not good enough. The script basically use the pig script with java udf to find out the new centroids for each iteration and use the python to process the iteration and update the centers and corresponding parameters. The output of the kmeans script are the two parts. One part is called grouped which contains the center of each cluster and the points in the cluster. The other part is called output which are only the final centers after the clustering method. 
There is an additional pig script called finalstep.pig which calculate the rec_rate, size for each cluster and output them for each centers. I run the code on EMR and it turned out to be 6 mins per iteration which is rather slow, so I give up and abandone the idea. But at the same time, I also show the modified code here in case you need them later.
